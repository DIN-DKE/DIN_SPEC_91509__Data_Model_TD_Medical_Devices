 &lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 1.5;"&gt;-&amp;gt; intended purpose, intended target populations, indications contraindications, etc. are treated as separate contents in the MDR, i.e. intended purpose not a over-term for many sub-terms! The intended purpose is usually a short statement of two or three sentences that focuses on what the device is intended to be used for.  It is a required item in the Technical Documentation (Annex II, 1.1) https://eumdr.com/intended-purpose/ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

  Current situation in Europe: &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Both terms appear to be part of everyday language in the industry and documentation for medical devices.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Only Intended Purpose is defined in the European Medical Device Regulation, but both terms are used in the law: Intended Purpose 87x, Intended Use 16x.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There is no clear definition, which detailed information belongs to the Intended Purpose and/or Intended Use.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Both terms are used in some European MDCG guidelines in a slightly different way. Both terms are used very vaguely and contain - if at all mentioned in guidelines - only examples of associated detailed information, but not a comprehensive overview.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In the international context, many standards with relevance for the medical device industry use the same definition for intended purpose and intended use (e.g. ISO 14971 and at least 15 other standards). Their definition is based on the definition for &amp;quot;Intended use&amp;quot; as defined in ISO/IEC Guide 63:2019, 3.4. - Guide to the development and inclusion of aspects of safety in International Standards for medical devices. This guide lists typical elements of the intended use, such the intended medical indication, patient population, part of the body or type of tissue interacted with, user profile, use environment, and operating principle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  Based on this situation, the data model does not differentiate between Intended Purpose/Intended Use in order to provide sufficient flexibility.&lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Use of the KT within a company: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  If a company wants to differentiate between these two terms, the data model can be extended with additional company specific KTs in which the separate definitions for Intended Purpose and Intended Use can be defined. In that case, that separate KTs (each for Intended Purpose and Intended Use) have a child - parent relatationship with the higher-level generic KT Intended Purpose/Intended Use that is part of the released public data model. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  Intended Purpose/Intended Use Lifecycle&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Information related to the intended purpose/intended use evolves over the complete product lifecycle and is not entirely static. For example, typically information such as the medical purpose, indication and patient population are defined as input for product development. Later, during the development phase, information about contra-indications, warnings are added. And as results of post-market surveillance activities, the need for changes of intended purpose/intended use information may arise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

            <justification>&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Currently, we have an unclear regulatory situation in Europe: &lt;br/&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
  Based on those facts, we decided that the data model shall not differentiate between Intended Purpose/Intended Use in order to provide sufficient flexibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 The existing definition in the MDR is not clear enough from our point of view: it only provides information about a few elements of the technical documentation in which information about intended purpose can be found. This list is not comprehensive. Furthermore, the MDR definition does not consider and provide additional &lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Information related to the product lifecycle of a medical device.&lt;/span&gt;</justification>

  &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;„Nebenwirkung“ bezeichnet einen unbeabsichtigten, meist unerwünschten Effekt bei Patienten, Anwendern oder Dritten, der beim bestimmungsmäßigen Gebrauch eines Medizinprodukts im Zusammenhang mit dem gewünschten Effekt auftritt und auf die Anwendung des Produkts zurückzuführen ist, und der nicht auf eine Fehlfunktion, Verschlechterung der Eigenschaften oder Leistung oder eine Unzulänglichkeit der vom Hersteller bereitgestellten Informationen zurückzuführen ist.&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &amp;quot;Side-effect means an unintended effect, usually undesirable, on patients, users or other persons, which occurs during the intended use of a medical device in connection with the desired effect and which is related to the use of the device, and which is not due to a malfunction, deterioration in the characteristics or performance, or inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer.&amp;quot;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

An ‘undesirable side-effect’ under the MDR should be understood as any unintended and unwanted medical manifestation in the human body, as a consequence of the normal use of a device.&lt;sup&gt;17 &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 1.5;"&gt;Undesirable side-effects are not the result of a malfunction, deterioration in the device’s characteristics or performance, or an inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer. An unsuccessful treatment (or treatment failure) should not be considered an undesirable side effect. For the purpose of this guidance, undesirable side-effects can be expected or unexpected and are considered as incidents under the MDR (Article 2(64) MDR).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Footnote 17 from MDCG 2023-03:&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 1.5;"&gt;It should be noted that the terms ‘undesirable side-effects’ and ‘side-effects’ are used synonymously in the MDR.&lt;/span&gt;</definition>

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Undesirable side-effects are not the result of a malfunction, deterioration in the device’s characteristics or performance, or an inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An unsuccessful treatment (treatment failure), or consequences from misuse should not be considered an undesirable side effect.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expected side-effects must be evaluated in the Risk Analysis AND Clinical Evaluation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expected side-effects must be mentioned in the Instruction Manual (IFU).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(New) Unexpected side-effects are identified via PMCF/PMS data or Clinical Evaluation and records referring to any undesirable sideeffects. should be considered in the PSUR/PMS Report&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(New, unknown) unexpected side-effects are later expected side-effects, when documented in the Risk Analysis. &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;„Nebenwirkung“ bezeichnet einen unbeabsichtigten, meist unerwünschten Effekt bei Patienten, Anwendern oder Dritten, der beim bestimmungsmäßigen Gebrauch eines Medizinprodukts im Zusammenhang mit dem gewünschten Effekt auftritt und auf die Anwendung des Produkts zurückzuführen ist, und der nicht auf eine Fehlfunktion, Verschlechterung der Eigenschaften oder Leistung oder eine Unzulänglichkeit der vom Hersteller bereitgestellten Informationen zurückzuführen ist.&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &amp;quot;Side-effect means an unintended effect, usually undesirable, on patients, users or other persons, which occurs during the intended use of a medical device in connection with the desired effect and which is related to the use of the device, and which is not due to a malfunction, deterioration in the characteristics or performance, or inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer.&amp;quot;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;2) MDCG 2023-03, Q&amp;amp;A-8.:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
An ‘undesirable side-effect’ under the MDR should be understood as any unintended and unwanted medical manifestation in the human body, as a consequence of the normal use of a device.&lt;sup&gt;17 &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 1.5;"&gt;Undesirable side-effects are not the result of a malfunction, deterioration in the device’s characteristics or performance, or an inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer. An unsuccessful treatment (or treatment failure) should not be considered an undesirable side effect. For the purpose of this guidance, undesirable side-effects can be expected or unexpected and are considered as incidents under the MDR (Article 2(64) MDR).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Footnote 17 from MDCG 2023-03:&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 1.5;"&gt;It should be noted that the terms ‘undesirable side-effects’ and ‘side-effects’ are used synonymously in the MDR.&lt;/span&gt;</background>

            <description>&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;color: #000000;"&gt;The intended patient population refers to the specific group of patients for whom the medical device is designed to be used. Referenced patient populations refer to the natural states of human being. &lt;/span&gt;</description>
            <application>
                <applicability>&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Patient Population related information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  Specific medical conditions of patients to be diagnosed, treated, and/or monitored, etc. are referenced by &amp;quot;indications for use&amp;quot; (if relevant).  &lt;br/&gt;
  Restrictions within a defined intended patient population, because of specific medical conditions of patients, are referenced by contra-indications (if relevant).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Use of Attributes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Attributes depend on required level of detail for a specific devices, e.g. age, gender, anatomy, physiology, possibly other aspects (MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4, Appendix A1).&lt;br/&gt;
 There are several guidances for grouping of patients. Here is one example in accordance with Ages of patient groups are classified according to the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Berlin 2023: 
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fetuses&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;font-size: 10pt;color: #000000;line-height: 1.5;"&gt;Neonates (up to the completed 28th day of life)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;font-size: 10pt;color: #000000;line-height: 1.5;"&gt;Infants (from the beginning of the 29th day of life until the end of the 12th month)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;font-size: 10pt;color: #000000;line-height: 1.5;"&gt;Toddlers (from the beginning of the 2nd to the end of the 3rd year of life)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;font-size: 10pt;color: #000000;line-height: 1.5;"&gt;Children (from the beginning of the 4th to the end of the 12th year of life)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;font-size: 10pt;color: #000000;line-height: 1.5;"&gt;Adults (from the beginning of the 19th year of life)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;font-size: 10pt;color: #000000;line-height: 1.5;"&gt;Women&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;font-size: 10pt;color: #000000;line-height: 1.5;"&gt;Obese patients (BMI of 30 or higher)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;font-size: 10pt;color: #000000;line-height: 1.5;"&gt;Pregnant women&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In the practical use of this KT an overview might be given about the intended patient populations or it might be possible to describe each patient group in a separate KU. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&amp;quot;Intended patient population&amp;quot; is identical as &amp;quot;Patient Population&amp;quot; (see ISO 14791). &lt;/span&gt;</applicability>

            <description>&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;color: #000000;"&gt;A medical condition is a health condition (pathologic or non-pathologic) that lies outside the range of normal age-appropriate human variation and normally requires medical treatment. A medical condition can include:&lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; disease/illness&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; injury/lesion,&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; disorder,&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; genetic or congenital defect,&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; a biological or physiological condition &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; psychological condition&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;There is &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;no clear definition&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;differentiation&lt;/span&gt; between &amp;quot;medical condition&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;clinical condition&amp;quot; &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt; in regulatory documents for medical devices. &lt;br/&gt;
MDCG 2020-7/ MDCG 2020-08 Section B (8) includes a foot note with a &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;mixture&lt;/span&gt; of the terms &amp;quot;clinical condition&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;medical condition&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;

Therefore a separate proposal for the term &amp;quot;Medical Condition&amp;quot; has been made. The new proposal is based on source: &lt;a href="https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/medical-condition" target="_top" class="descriptionLink"&gt;https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/medical-condition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

---&lt;br/&gt;
German: &lt;br/&gt;
-&amp;gt; Medical Condition = Gesundheitszustand / Mediziner Zustand = in deutscher MDR wird &amp;quot;Krankheitszustand&amp;quot; verwendet (z.B. Schwergrad der Krankheit?)&lt;br/&gt;
-&amp;gt; Clinical Condition = Krankheitsbild / Klinischer Zustand --&amp;gt; Beschreibung des Zustands des Patienten (z.B. Durchfall, Fieber,... sonstige Symptome) &lt;br/&gt;
-&amp;gt; Indication = Indikation &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Klinisch ist ein Begriff der medizinischen Umgangssprache, der je nach Kontext verschiedene Bedeutungen haben kann. Meistens wird klinisch als Kurzform für &amp;quot;klinische Zeichen&amp;quot; oder das &amp;quot;klinische Bild&amp;quot;, also für direkt erkennbare Symptome und Beschwerden des Patienten benutzt. Der Begriff dient dabei zur Abgrenzung gegenüber anderen, &amp;quot;paraklinischen&amp;quot; Formen der Diagnostik. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Beispiele: Klinisch hat der Patient Durchfall, in der Stuhluntersuchung wurden Noroviren festgestellt. Der Stuhl war positiv auf Noroviren, der Patient hat aber keine Klinik (d.h. keinen Durchfall und/oder Erbrechen).  &lt;a href="https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Klinisch#:~:text=1%20Definition,und%20Beschwerden%20des%20Patienten%20benutzt" target="_blank"&gt;https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Klinisch#:~:text=1%20Definition,und%20Beschwerden%20des%20Patienten%20benutzt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;

            <justification>Definition in MDR is not correct. Indication and disease is not identical: &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;quot;An indication can commonly be confused with the term &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis" target="_top" title="Medical diagnosis"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;. A diagnosis is the assessment that a particular [medical] condition is present while an&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; indication is a reason for use&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indication_(medicine)#cite_note-3" target="_top"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;opposite of an indication is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication" target="_top" title="Contraindication"&gt;contraindication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indication_(medicine)#cite_note-4" target="_top"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; a reason to withhold a certain medical treatment because the risks of treatment clearly outweigh the benefits.&amp;quot; Source: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indication_(medicine)" target="_top" class="descriptionLink"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indication_(medicine)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Existing regulatory documents to not use the term &amp;quot;indication&amp;quot; according in the way. Not all medical devices have a clear indication as part of the intended purpose. Therefore many medical device manufacturers describe a medical procedure instead. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
At the end, it is important that at least the indication(s) or medical procedure is described for each medical device.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Clinical condition refers to the patient state of health based on symptoms and test results. &lt;br/&gt;
On the other hand a medical condition refers to a specific disease. Nevertheless it is not defined in the text of the MDR, the terms are used in different sections without clear destinction.</justification>

       This section describes situations in which the device should not 
       be used because the risk of use clearly outweights any possible 
       benefit.  Examples that may, but not always, contraindicate the 
       use of a device include:

            Hypersensitivity to an ingredient of a permanently  
            implanted device;
            Substantial risk of being harmed because of age, sex, 
            concomitant therapy, disease state or other condition; or,
            Continued use in the face of an unacceptably hazardous 
            adverse reaction. 

       Known hazards and not theoretical possibilities are to be
       listed, e.g., if hypersensitivity to an ingredient in the device 
       has not been demonstrated, it should not be listed as a     
       contraindication.  The &amp;quot;Contraindications&amp;quot; section shall 
       immediately follow the &amp;quot;Indications for Use&amp;quot; section of the 
       labeling.  If no contraindications are known, this section of 
       the labeling should state &amp;quot;None known.&amp;quot;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Appendix E, Warnings and precautions:&lt;br/&gt;
What are warnings and precautions?&lt;br/&gt;
Warnings and precautions are written, pictorial, and/or audible alerts to a hazard. The term used to identify the particular hazard presents the reader with a cue to the seriousness of the hazard. &lt;br/&gt;
A &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;warning&lt;/span&gt; alerts the reader about a situation which, if not avoided, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;"&gt;could result in death or serious injury&lt;/span&gt;. [ANSI Z535.4-1998] It may also describe potential serious adverse reactions and safety hazards. The designation of a hazard alert as a &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;"&gt;“warning” is reserved for the most significant problems&lt;/span&gt;. The term WARNING is generally used as the signal word for this type of hazard alert. If a problem may lead to death or serious injury, FDA may expect you to highlight the warning by placing it in a box.&lt;br/&gt;
The distinction between warnings and precautions is a &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;matter of degree of likelihood and seriousness of the hazard&lt;/span&gt;. The target audience for medical device labeling (health care practitioners and lay users of home use devices) generally recognize a hierarchy of hazard alerts, with &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;"&gt;warnings being those of a more serious nature&lt;/span&gt; and precautions being of a less serious, but important, nature. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
What is the purpose of warnings and precautions in medical device labeling? &lt;br/&gt;
The basic purpose of a warning or precaution is twofold: &lt;br/&gt;
· to inform users of potential personal and environmental hazards, and &lt;br/&gt;
· to persuade them to modify their behavior to avoid injury or device damage. &lt;br/&gt;
For a warning or precaution to be effective, readers must: &lt;br/&gt;
· perceive the threat to be both severe and relevant to them, &lt;br/&gt;
· believe that they can perform the recommended response, and &lt;br/&gt;
· believe that response will be effective in avoiding the hazard. &lt;br/&gt;
Effective warnings and precautions capture the reader’s attention, are understood, are consistent enough with the reader’s beliefs and attitudes to be accepted, and are persuasive enough to motivate the reader to comply. They invoke an appropriate level of fear arousal, conveying the nature and extent of the hazard, without being so strong that they backfire, causing the reader to select an alternative action or no action.&lt;br/&gt;

       Describe serious adverse reactions and potential safety hazards, 
       limitations in use imposed by them, and steps that should be 
       taken if they occur.
       
       Include an appropriate warning if there is reasonable evidence 
       of an association of a serious hazard with the use of the 
       device.  A causal relationship need not have been proved.

       A warning is appropriate when the device is commonly used for a 
       disease or condition for which there is a lack of valid 
       scientific evidence of effectiveness for that disease or 
       condition and such usage is associated with a serious risk or

A &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;warning&lt;/span&gt; alerts the reader about a situation which, if not avoided, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;"&gt;could result in death or serious injury&lt;/span&gt;. [ANSI Z535.4-1998] It may also describe potential serious adverse reactions and safety hazards. The designation of a hazard alert as a &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;"&gt;“warning” is reserved for the most significant problems&lt;/span&gt;. The term WARNING is generally used as the signal word for this type of hazard alert. If a problem may lead to death or serious injury, FDA may expect you to highlight the warning by placing it in a box.&lt;br/&gt;
The distinction between warnings and precautions is a &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;matter of degree of likelihood and seriousness of the hazard&lt;/span&gt;. The target audience for medical device labeling (health care practitioners and lay users of home use devices) generally recognize a hierarchy of hazard alerts, with &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;"&gt;warnings being those of a more serious nature&lt;/span&gt; and precautions being of a less serious, but important, nature. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
What is the purpose of warnings and precautions in medical device labeling? &lt;br/&gt;
The basic purpose of a warning or precaution is twofold: &lt;br/&gt;
· to inform users of potential personal and environmental hazards, and &lt;br/&gt;
· to persuade them to modify their behavior to avoid injury or device damage. &lt;br/&gt;
For a warning or precaution to be effective, readers must: &lt;br/&gt;
· perceive the threat to be both severe and relevant to them, &lt;br/&gt;
· believe that they can perform the recommended response, and &lt;br/&gt;
· believe that response will be effective in avoiding the hazard. &lt;br/&gt;
Effective warnings and precautions capture the reader’s attention, are understood, are consistent enough with the reader’s beliefs and attitudes to be accepted, and are persuasive enough to motivate the reader to comply. They invoke an appropriate level of fear arousal, conveying the nature and extent of the hazard, without being so strong that they backfire, causing the reader to select an alternative action or no action.&lt;br/&gt;

  &lt;pre style="color: #333333;"&gt; Warnings

       Describe serious adverse reactions and potential safety hazards, 
       limitations in use imposed by them, and steps that should be 
       taken if they occur.
       
       Include an appropriate warning if there is reasonable evidence 
       of an association of a serious hazard with the use of the 
       device.  A causal relationship need not have been proved.

       A warning is appropriate when the device is commonly used for a 
       disease or condition for which there is a lack of valid 
       scientific evidence of effectiveness for that disease or 
       condition and such usage is associated with a serious risk or 
       hazard.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</background>

Mode of action would be defined as “the means by which a product achieves a therapeutic effect.” For purposes of this definition, “therapeutic” effect or action includes any effect or action of the combination product intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease, or affect the structure or any function of the body. Products may have a drug, biological product, or device mode of action. Because combination products are comprised of more than one type of regulated article (biological product, device, or drug), and each constituent part contributes a biological product, device, or drug mode of action, combination products will typically have more than one mode of action.&lt;br/&gt;</definition>

  &lt;li&gt;Evaluate how many patients have been exposed to the device and the characteristics of the exposed patient group(s).&lt;/li&gt;

            <justification>There is no clear definition of the term. The term &amp;quot;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;color: #000000;"&gt;Size of patient population&amp;quot; is a pretty broad term. Different meanings are possible: e.g. number of patients have been exposed to the device or similar/equivalent devices, treated with alternative methods, size of patient population involved in a clinical study, etc. Size of patient population involved in a clinical study is relevant for strength of evidence provided within clinical evaluation, but not for definition of intended use. Therefore a new definition and attributes have been proposed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
MDCG 2022-21 (for PSUR) gives a detailed guidance how to present and structure the data of this KT.&lt;br/&gt;

The intended purpose/intended use statement is used whenever a short version of the comprehensive intended purpose/intended use description is needed, e.g. for product certificates, Eudamed, or different documents of the technical documentation/different processes that ask for the intended purpose. &lt;br/&gt;

            <background>There is no regulatory document that uses a term that we can consider a &amp;quot;short version&amp;quot; of the intended purpose/intended use. Different regulatory documents use the terms &amp;quot;intended purpose&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;intended use&amp;quot;, with partly different interpretations, which single information items are included. See also information provided for the  &lt;span class="polarion-rte-link" data-type="workItem" id="fake" data-item-id="ID-2663" data-option-id="long"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;</background>
            <justification>The MDR requires in Annex XII, Chapter 1, 4. (a) that the intended purpose shall be documented on certificates. According to MDR, Article 2 (12), the intended purpose is a term that includes a hughe variety of information, that cannot be documented on a certificate. Practically, only a short form of the intended purpose can be documented on the certificate. It is therefore mandatory to clearly differentiate between the comprehensive intended purpose (including all details) and the short version, for which we introducted the term &amp;quot;intended purpose statement&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Currently it is not clear in the MDR, when/where the comprehensive intended purpose and when/where the intended purpose statement is required. The same problem occurs on the Eudamed website (intended purpose field has limited number of characters, and the Clinical Evaluation Assessment Report (CEAR) Template for Notified Bodies (see MDCG 2020-13). For the last two, we recommend the use of the &amp;quot;intended purpose statement&amp;quot;. Furthermore, &amp;quot;intended purpose&amp;quot; information is required on the label (MDR, Annex I, 23.2 (b)), marketing material, instructions for use - here it is not clear again, if the comprehensive or short version is required. &lt;br/&gt;</justification>

  The operating principle for a MEDICAL DEVICE includes descriptions of:&lt;br/&gt;
  – physical methods used to accomplish its INTENDED USE; and&lt;br/&gt;
     EXAMPLE 1 A scalpel using highly focused laser energy.&lt;br/&gt;
     EXAMPLE 2 A scalpel using sharpened stainless steel blade.&lt;br/&gt;
     EXAMPLE 3 A scalpel using high-energy HF electromagnetic fields.&lt;br/&gt;
  – mechanisms by which it works.&lt;br/&gt;
     EXAMPLE 4 An intravenous infusion pump delivers medication through an intravenous line connected to a PATIENT catheter by a peristaltic                                      mechanism employing rollers and mechanical fingers that squeeze and push fluid through plastic tubing.&lt;br/&gt;
     EXAMPLE 5 An intravenous infusion pump delivers medication through an intravenous line connected to a PATIENT catheter by a volumetric                                    pump that has plungers connected to a diaphragm on a cassette mechanism connected to PATIENT tubing that draws fluid from                                    an IV bag by creating a vacuum within the cassette mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Operating principle definition from a Canadian source: &lt;br/&gt;
 Operating principles are the means by which a device produces or brings about an intended or appropriate effect. They are the means whereby a device is able to have a certain influence on a person or its surroundings.&lt;br/&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Complication are not defined nor mentioned in MDR nor in ISO 14971. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are mentioned in MEDDEV 2.7./1 Rev. 4., MDCG 2020-10-1 and 2021-6, but without a definition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Existing medical definitions focus on medical complications that are unrelated to a medical device use. Therefore we propose a new definition in the context of medical device use. &lt;/li&gt;

Appendix E, Warnings and precautions:&lt;br/&gt;
What are warnings and precautions?&lt;br/&gt;
The term &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;precaution&lt;/span&gt; is used for the statement of a hazard alert that warns the reader of a potentially hazardous situation which, if not avoided, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;"&gt;may result in minor or moderate injury to the user or patient or damage to the equipment or other property&lt;/span&gt;. [ANSI Z535.4-1998] It may also be used to alert against unsafe practices. This includes the special care necessary for the safe and effective use of the device and the care necessary to avoid damage to a device that may occur as a result of use or misuse. &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;"&gt;The word CAUTION is generally used as the signal word for a precaution statement&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;
The distinction between warnings and precautions is a &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;matter of degree of likelihood and seriousness of the hazard&lt;/span&gt;. The target audience for medical device labeling (health care practitioners and lay users of home use devices) generally recognize a hierarchy of hazard alerts, with warnings being those of a more serious nature and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;"&gt;precautions being of a less serious, but important&lt;/span&gt;, nature. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;existing guiding questions by the FDA in order to identify precautions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
What is the purpose of warnings and precautions in medical device labeling? &lt;br/&gt;
The basic purpose of a warning or precaution is twofold: &lt;br/&gt;
· to inform users of potential personal and environmental hazards, and &lt;br/&gt;
· to persuade them to modify their behavior to avoid injury or device damage. &lt;br/&gt;
For a warning or precaution to be effective, readers must: &lt;br/&gt;
· perceive the threat to be both severe and relevant to them, &lt;br/&gt;
· believe that they can perform the recommended response, and &lt;br/&gt;
· believe that response will be effective in avoiding the hazard. &lt;br/&gt;
Effective warnings and precautions capture the reader’s attention, are understood, are consistent enough with the reader’s beliefs and attitudes to be accepted, and are persuasive enough to motivate the reader to comply. They invoke an appropriate level of fear arousal, conveying the nature and extent of the hazard, without being so strong that they backfire, causing the reader to select an alternative action or no action.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;

       Include information regarding any special care to be exercised 
       by the practitioner and/or patient for the safe and effective 
       use of the device, for example:

            - Indicate or emphasize any need for protective wear during         
              use.

            - Identify any laboratory tests or other evaluations that
              may be helpful in following the patient&amp;#39;s response or in
              identifying adverse reactions and, if appropriate,             
              specify  the frequency of such tests or evaluations 
              before, during and after use of the device.

       statements not appropriate for inclusion under other sections of

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is no clear definition and differentiation between &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;restrictions for use&lt;/span&gt; and&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;limitations&lt;/span&gt; of the device.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restriction for use does not include contraindication, eg imposed by restricting the use for certain patient groups.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restriction for use does not include restriction regarding certification. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Collins English Dictionary &amp;quot;restriction&amp;quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 A restriction is an official rule that limits what you can do or that limits the amount or size of something.&lt;br/&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;a &amp;quot;limitation&amp;quot; is an inability for something/someone. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a &amp;quot;restriction&amp;quot; is externally imposed to stop something, usually by law. &lt;/li&gt;

            <description>&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;color: #000000;"&gt;The type of application/contribution to the medical purpose describes the type of the involvement of a medical device in a medical or technical procedure to achieve the medical purpose of the device.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

            <justification>The definition for this KT arises from the practical need to describe what type of application a medical device is used for. The indication acc. to MDCG 2020-6 served as input in that it takes the perspective of the opposite side, namely the description of the indication for which a particular medical device could be specific. For medical devices with indirect clinical benefit an indication is often not relevant, etc. is related to the illness, disability, to be treated, diagnosed, etc.</justification>

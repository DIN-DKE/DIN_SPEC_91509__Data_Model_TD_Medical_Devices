If a problem may lead to death or serious injury, FDA may expect you to highlight the warning by placing it in a box.<br/>\nThe distinction between warnings and precautions is a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">matter of degree of likelihood and seriousness of the hazard</span>. The target audience for medical device labeling (health care practitioners and lay users of home use devices) generally recognize a hierarchy of hazard alerts, with <span style=\"font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;\">warnings being those of a more serious nature</span> and precautions being of a less serious, but important, nature. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat is the purpose of warnings and precautions in medical device labeling? <br/>\nThe basic purpose of a warning or precaution is twofold: <br/>\n· to inform users of potential personal and environmental hazards, and <br/>\n· to persuade them to modify their behavior to avoid injury or device damage. <br/>\nFor a warning or precaution to be effective, readers must: <br/>\n· perceive the threat to be both severe and relevant to them, <br/>\n· believe that they can perform the recommended response, and <br/>\n· believe that response will be effective in avoiding the hazard. <br/>\nEffective warnings and precautions capture the reader’s attention, are understood, are consistent enough with the reader’s beliefs and attitudes to be accepted, and are persuasive enough to motivate the reader to comply. They invoke an appropriate level of fear arousal, conveying the nature and extent of the hazard, without being so strong that they backfire, causing the reader to select an alternative action or no action.<br/>\n <br/>\n <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">--&gt; Definition from <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;line-height: 1.5;\">Device Labeling Guidance #G91-1</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;line-height: 1.5;\"> (Blue Book Memo) (<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/device-labeling-guidance-g91-1-blue-book-memo\" target=\"_top\" class=\"descriptionLink\">https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/device-labeling-guidance-g91-1-blue-book-memo</a>  )<br/>\n  <pre style=\"color: #333333;\"> Warnings\n\n       Describe serious adverse reactions and potential safety hazards, \n       limitations in use imposed by them, and steps that should be \n       taken if they occur.\n       \n       Include an appropriate warning if there is reasonable evidence \n       of an association of a serious hazard with the use of the \n       device.

Practically, only a short form of the intended purpose can be documented on the certificate. It is therefore mandatory to clearly differentiate between the comprehensive intended purpose (including all details) and the short version, for which we introducted the term &quot;intended purpose statement&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nCurrently it is not clear in the MDR, when/where the comprehensive intended purpose and when/where the intended purpose statement is required. The same problem occurs on the Eudamed website (intended purpose field has limited number of characters, and the Clinical Evaluation Assessment Report (CEAR) Template for Notified Bodies (see MDCG 2020-13). For the last two, we recommend the use of the &quot;intended purpose statement&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;intended purpose&quot; information is required on the label (MDR, Annex I, 23.2 (b)), marketing material, instructions for use - here it is not clear again, if the comprehensive or short version is required. <br/>",

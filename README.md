## Overview of DIN SPEC 91509

DIN SPEC 91509 defines a structured, interoperable data model for representing the Technical Documentation of medical devices. Its objective is to translate regulatory requirements—particularly in the context of the EU MDR—into a consistent, machine-readable structure.

### Core Objectives

- Standardization of the structure of technical documentation  
- Improved traceability and consistency of regulatory content  
- Enablement of digital workflows and automation  
- Promotion of interoperability between manufacturers, service providers, and authorities  

The specification addresses the growing complexity of regulatory requirements by establishing a shared semantic foundation for digital documentation processes.
